Description: Wage disparities between men and women in labor economics are influenced by factors like differences in college majors. For example, 88% of Aerospace Engineering majors are male, while 97% of Early Childhood Education majors are female. This study aims to analyze the relationship between college majors, occupations, and the gender wage gap using data from the American Community Survey (ACS). It examines how these factors have evolved across birth cohorts and their impact on wages. Using ACS data, the study examines college-educated individuals from the 1950s to 1990s, introducing the concept of "potential wage" to evaluate how majors and occupations affect the gender wage gap. The gender wage gap among college-educated individuals can be explained by differences in college majors and occupations. Article's Results: Majors and occupations reduce the gender wage gap significantly (R² = 0.37), lowering it to 11.4%. For older cohorts, the gap dropped from 32.2% to 16.8%, and for younger cohorts, from 15.5% to 6.5%. Major has a small negative impact on the gender wage gap, but other variables show no significant effect, suggesting unmeasured factors may influence the gap. Women tend to choose lower-wage majors. The wage gap between men and women narrowed from 12% for those born in 1950 to 9% for those born in 1990. Women in engineering also tend to hold lower-paying jobs than men within the same field. While the article’s results show that majors and occupations explain much of the gender wage gap, our findings indicate that other unmeasured factors may also play a role.
