Description: Wage disparities between men and women are shaped by differences in college majors and occupations. For example, 88% of Aerospace Engineering majors are male, while 97% of Early Childhood Education majors are female. This study analyzes how these factors impact the gender wage gap using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) across birth cohorts from the 1950s to 1990s. Results show that majors and occupations account for a significant portion of the gap, reducing it to 11.4% (RÂ² = 0.37). The gap dropped from 32.2% to 16.8% for older cohorts and from 15.5% to 6.5% for younger cohorts. However, unmeasured factors may also contribute, as women often choose lower-wage majors and hold lower-paying jobs within the same fields.
